# Atomistic-Modeling-of-Argon-MS-MD-
Implementing molecular statics (MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Lennard-Jones Argon clusters to study structural relaxation, energy evolution, and temperature-dependent phase behavior. All simulations were performed on free-surface FCC clusters using a spline-smoothed LJ potential and integrated with the Velocity Verlet algorithm.
